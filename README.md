# Prog2
In this task I have made it possible to push and commit code from VS Code.
For that to work i had to change somethings in my pom.xml file.
I had to see on GitHub on how to do it with Maven and on the GitHub site i did find what i had to have in my pom.xml file.
For github to work for me i had to and my username and a token for github to recognize the push and commit request.
To make the github actions i had to change the test file name, the name i had first was testoblig2 and github did not find the test file.

Link where i found what to have in my POM.xml and settings.xml: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages
