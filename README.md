# Prog2
In this task I have made it possible to push and commit code from VS Code.
For that to work i had to change somethings in my pom.xml file.
I had to see on GitHub on how to do it with Maven and on the GitHub site i did find what i had to have in my pom.xml file.
For github to work for me i had to and my username and a token for github to recognize the push and commit request.
To make the github actions i had to change the test file name, the name i had first was testoblig2 and github did not find the test file.
